# WSL

{{% hint warning %}}
If you are using macOS or Linux, ignore this page.
{{% /hint %}}

Follow the official instructions for setting up WSL:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

When WSL has been installed it is equivalent of running Linux and all tools we
install will be the linux versions of the tools. This means that when you read
installation instructions, you should always follow the linux instructions and
**NOT** the windows ones.
