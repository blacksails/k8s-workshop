# Hardware

You will need access to a laptop with a unix environment. This can be a macOS
or linux environment. When running on windows you will need to have WSL
installed and setup. See [the WSL instructions](./wsl) for more info.

If you have a personal laptop which isen't contrained by corporate software I
would highly recommend that you use that for the workshop, in order to avoid
wasting time on getting stuff working on a locked down PC.
