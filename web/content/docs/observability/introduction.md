# Introduction to Observability

## What is Observability?

Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system by
examining its external outputs. In the context of distributed systems and
Kubernetes, observability is crucial for understanding how your applications
behave in production, diagnosing issues, and maintaining system health.

Modern applications running on Kubernetes are inherently complex, with multiple
services, containers, and dependencies. Without proper observability, debugging
issues becomes like finding a needle in a haystack. Observability gives you the
tools and insights needed to understand what's happening inside your systems.

## The Three Pillars of Observability

Observability is traditionally built on three foundational pillars, each
providing different perspectives on your system's behavior:

### 1. Logs

**Logs** are time-ordered records of discrete events that happened within your
application or infrastructure. They provide detailed, contextual information
about what your system was doing at specific points in time.

Logs are particularly useful for:
- Debugging specific errors or issues
- Understanding application flow and business logic
- Compliance and audit requirements
- Root cause analysis

**Common Technologies:**
- **[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/)** - Search and
  analytics engine for log data
- **[Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/)** - Open source data collector for
  unified logging layer
- **[Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/)** - Horizontally-scalable, highly-
  available, multi-tenant log aggregation system

### 2. Metrics

**Metrics** are numerical measurements taken over time. They provide quantitative
data about your system's performance, resource usage, and behavior patterns.
Metrics are typically aggregated and stored as time series data.

Metrics excel at:
- Monitoring system performance and health
- Setting up alerts and notifications
- Capacity planning and scaling decisions
- Understanding trends and patterns over time

**Common Technologies:**
- **[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)** - Open-source monitoring system with
  time series database
- **[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/)** - Time series database optimized
  for metrics
- **[StatsD](https://github.com/statsd/statsd)** - Network daemon for collecting
  and aggregating metrics

### 3. Traces

**Traces** track the journey of a request as it flows through different services
in a distributed system. They provide a detailed view of how services interact
and where time is spent during request processing.

Traces are essential for:
- Understanding service dependencies
- Identifying performance bottlenecks
- Debugging issues in distributed systems
- Optimizing request flow and latency

**Common Technologies:**
- **[Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/)** - Open source, distributed tracing
  platform
- **[Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/)** - Distributed tracing system that helps
  gather timing data
- **[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)** - Collection of tools, APIs,
  and SDKs for telemetry data

## How the Pillars Work Together

While each pillar provides valuable insights on its own, they're most powerful
when used together:

- **Metrics** help you identify *that* something is wrong
- **Logs** help you understand *what* went wrong
- **Traces** help you see *where* in your system the problem occurred

For example, you might notice high error rates in your metrics, use traces to
identify which service is failing, and then examine logs from that service to
understand the root cause.

## Observability in Kubernetes

Kubernetes adds additional complexity to observability because:

- Applications run in ephemeral containers that can be created and destroyed
  frequently
- Services are distributed across multiple nodes and pods
- The platform itself (Kubernetes components) needs monitoring
- Resource allocation and scheduling decisions affect application performance

A comprehensive Kubernetes observability strategy typically includes:
- **Application metrics and logs** from your services
- **Infrastructure metrics** from nodes, pods, and containers
- **Kubernetes platform metrics** from API server, scheduler, and other
  components
- **Network observability** for service-to-service communication

## Getting Started

In this chapter, we'll explore two fundamental tools for Kubernetes
observability:

1. **Prometheus** - For collecting and storing metrics
2. **Grafana** - For visualizing metrics and creating dashboards

These tools form the backbone of most Kubernetes monitoring setups and provide
a solid foundation for understanding observability concepts.

## Key Takeaways

- Observability helps you understand system behavior through external signals
- The three pillars (logs, metrics, traces) provide complementary perspectives
- Modern distributed systems require observability to be effective
- Kubernetes environments need specialized observability approaches
- Prometheus and Grafana are fundamental tools in the Kubernetes ecosystem

In the next sections, we'll dive deeper into Prometheus for metrics collection
and Grafana for visualization and dashboards.
