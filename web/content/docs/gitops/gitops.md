# Introduction to GitOps

## Historical Perspective: Continuous Deployment Before GitOps

Traditionally, continuous deployment (CD) followed a "push-based" model where
external CI/CD systems would directly deploy applications to production
environments. Teams would typically:

- Use CI systems (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) to build and test code
- Store deployment scripts and configuration alongside application code
- Push deployments directly to production clusters using `kubectl` or similar
  tools
- Manage secrets and credentials in CI systems or external vaults
- Manually sync configuration changes between environments

This approach, while functional, introduced several challenges: credential
management became complex, deployment pipelines had direct access to production
systems, configuration drift was common between environments, and
troubleshooting deployment issues required access to both CI logs and cluster
state.

## What is GitOps?

GitOps revolutionizes this approach by implementing a "pull-based" deployment
model where Git repositories serve as the single source of truth for both
application code and infrastructure configuration. Instead of external systems
pushing changes to production, GitOps operators run inside the cluster and
continuously monitor Git repositories for changes, automatically pulling and
applying updates.

The core principle is simple: **if it's not in Git, it's not in production**.

## Why GitOps? Problems Solved and Advantages

GitOps addresses fundamental challenges of traditional CD while providing
significant operational advantages:

**Enhanced Security**: GitOps eliminates the need for external systems to have
direct access to production clusters. Instead of distributing cluster
credentials to CI systems, GitOps operators pull changes from Git, dramatically
reducing the attack surface.

**Complete Auditability**: Every change is tracked in Git with full history,
making it easy to see who changed what and when. Rollbacks become simple Git
reverts, and compliance becomes straightforward with a complete audit trail.

**Drift Prevention**: The desired state is always defined in Git, and GitOps
operators continuously reconcile the actual cluster state with the declared
state, automatically preventing configuration drift between environments.

**Simplified Disaster Recovery**: Since the entire system state is stored in
Git, rebuilding a cluster becomes a matter of pointing a GitOps operator at the
repository, enabling rapid recovery with confidence.

**Improved Developer Experience**: Teams can use familiar Git workflows for
both code and infrastructure changes, enabling collaboration through standard
review processes and reducing the learning curve for deployment operations.

**Built-in Observability**: GitOps provides clear visibility into deployment
status, drift detection, and system health, making troubleshooting more
straightforward than traditional CI/CD approaches.

## Popular GitOps Implementations

Two leading GitOps implementations have emerged in the Kubernetes ecosystem:

- **[Flux](https://fluxcd.io/)**: A CNCF graduated project offering a toolkit
  of controllers for GitOps workflows
- **[ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/)**: A declarative GitOps CD tool
  with a rich web UI and CLI
